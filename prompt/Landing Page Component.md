// Copilot Prompt:
// Create a LandingPage.tsx component in React (TypeScript + Vite + TailwindCSS).
// Use a clean, professional UI with modern layout and subtle animations (Framer Motion).
// Primary colors: amber-400 / amber-500 with complementary neutral backgrounds.
// Use Lucide icons (e.g., Building2, Search, UserPlus).
// Add two main CTAs: "Join as Business" and "Find Services".
// - "Join as Business" opens a registration modal.
// - "Find Services" redirects to /services page (placeholder for now).
// Make it visually appealing: hero section with headline + subheadline, illustration placeholder, CTA buttons.
// Add responsive design: stack vertically on mobile, grid on desktop.
// Include a navbar with brand logo/title and Login button (top-right).
// Animate CTA buttons on hover (scale, glow).
